Interests in IT
My purpose to study Bachelor of Information Technology is to upskill myself in Information Technology and to earn high income hopefully in the range of $150,000 plus. It is better to set a high target then a low target so there it is.   The accounting job market is highly competitive.   Without upgrading myself I would become less in demand. My interest in Information Technology started whilst I used Microsoft Excel formulas to automate daily accounting tasks. This saved time to complete the task and company resources. The simple task piques my interest to study IT. I do not extensive work experience in IT.  I tried to study “macro” or the coding side of Microsoft Excel and found it challenging.  However, I did use SQL to perform accounting reconciliation function in a short six months contract role.
There are two reasons why I chose to study IT at RMIT. First, it has the highest university ranking amongst other universities from the Open University. In 2023 it ranked 190 globally (1). Second, RMIT is based in Melbourne where I reside.    I am keen to connect with other students who are from Melbourne and hopefully we could become friends.
I expect to learn many aspects of IT to land myself to even better career and job.   It will also be explorative where I hope to gain better understanding of the many different aspects of IT before deciding on which area I want to focus and become an expert in.

What makes this position interesting to me is the salary in the range of $150 k to $160 k  plus super. I have previously studied SQL briefly at my undergraduate study.
There are a number of skills required for this role such as strong understanding of relational database, SQL, using SQL scripts, ability to identify bad legacy data, excellent communication skills, troubleshooting and debugging.  The job requires someone who has completed a Bachelor of Science or Software Engineering, more than five years of work experience in SQL, Microsoft SQL Server and data migration experience, and more than 1 year of work experience using XML. In addition, it would be considered advantageous to have SQL certification, experiences in SQL Server administration, Oracle DBMS administration, and other database management and development.
I studied a subject called Database as an elective in my undergraduate study. During a short term six months contract, I used SQL searched to perform accounting reconciliations.
